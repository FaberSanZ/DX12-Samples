</br>

This repository contains **small, progressive DirectX 12 examples**, designed to teach and demonstrate each part of the graphics pipeline in an intuitive and minimalistic way.  
Each sample is isolated and focused, making it easy to learn DX12 step by step, without unnecessary complexity.

## Examples


Example | Details
---------|--------
<img src="Screenshots/ClearScreen.png" width=380> | [Clear Screen](Src/ClearScreen)<br> This sample shows how to initialize DirectX 12, select a GPU (adapter), create a device, a command queue, a swap chain, a render target view (RTV) descriptor heap, and a command list to clear the screen to a solid color. All rendering commands are recorded into the command list, then executed through the command queue. If you pass nullptr when choosing the adapter, the default GPU (usually GPU 0) is selected.
